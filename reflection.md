- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming? 

It makes coding easier, because instead of having to start from scratch for each of the house, library, and cafe classes, half of the work was already done through the building class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

With inheritance, it is especially important to have a plan of what will be inherited and what won't, because it is easy to lose track of what the parent class does and doesn't do. This exercise has a relatively simple parent class, but my advice would still be to plan it out, as that is what was helpful for me.
